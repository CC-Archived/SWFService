# SWFService

## About

SWFService allows ActionScript developers to expose an AS3 class instance as a JavaScript service.

Once an AS3 class instance is registered with SWFService, JavaScript developers can obtain a dynamically generated proxy object to transparently interact with it; including getting and setting properties and accessors, calling synchronous and asynchronous methods, and adding and removing event listeners.
